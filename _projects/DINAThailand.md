This project re-examines the dynamics of economic inequality in Thailand from 1975. The main motivation lies in the lack of information on the richest citizens in household surveys, which can lead to a significant underestimation of the inequality level and to an inaccurate representation of the historical trend.

To deal with micro- and macro-level data gaps, administrative data (tax data in this case) and national accounts are utilised for a more consistent distributional series.
